# Lab 3

This lab focuses on using IoT cloud services, the two that will be used during this lab will be ThingSpeak
and Firebase.

[Exercise 1:](https://github.com/andy-ngo/SYSC3010_Ngo_Andy/blob/master/lab3/lab3-thingspeak-write.py)
This first part was just to get used to writing to the IoT cloud service of ThingSpeak. We had to write a
script that will read the SenseHat sensor readings of Temperature, Humidity and Pressure and send it all at
once. This will keep sending data every 2 minutes.

[Exercise 2:](https://github.com/andy-ngo/SYSC3010_Ngo_Andy/blob/master/lab3/lab3-thingspeak-read.py)
The second part of the lab was used to learn how to read the data that was sent to ThingSpeak in the first
part. We will then use the SenseHat and display the readings for the last 3 results of our partners data.

[Exercise 3:](https://github.com/andy-ngo/SYSC3010_Ngo_Andy/blob/master/lab3/lab3-firebase.py)
The last part of the lab was to use the IoT cloud service called Firebase and this is similar to ThingSpeak,
but has some small differences to the coding and the format. The goal here is Exercise 1 and 2 combined,
we have to write our sensor data onto Firebase and read our partners data from their Firebase.
