# Lab 2

This lab will go over the basics of sqlite database and how to log data onto from data collected from the Sense Hat.
First part of the lab goes over a tutorial of sqlite, and the next part will be implementing the data from the Sense Hat
onto the database where it will then be used to graph. Lastly is the learning how to use JSON, most of the code is 
already complete and just a few blanks to fill in.
