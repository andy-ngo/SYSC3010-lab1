# SYSC3010_Ngo_Andy
This repository will contain all of the labs that will be worked on through the semester for SYSC 3010

Lab 1:
Focuses on the tutorial of the Raspberry Pi and the Sense Hat, will be testing out the Sense Hat display by creating the code on the Raspberry Pi.
Will display our name for one file and the other will be displaying temperature, pressure and humidity.

Lab 2:
Focuses on learning how to use SQLite on the terminal and with the DBManager.
This will then be implemented with the Sense Hat that was covered in Lab 1,
We will be collecting data from the SenseHat and storing it in a db file.
This db file will then be used to visualize the data stored in the db file by 
plotting it all out. The last part of the lab will be going over JSON, this will
also be using SQLite to create a db file to store data obtained from the JSON
demo code. The data file will be storing the City and Wind Speed in a table.
