# SYSC3010_Andy_Ngo
This repository will contain all of the labs that will be worked on through the semester for SYSC 3010

## [Lab 1:](https://github.com/andy-ngo/SYSC3010_Ngo_Andy/tree/master/lab1)
Focuses on the tutorial of the Raspberry Pi and the Sense Hat, will be testing out the Sense Hat display by creating the code on the Raspberry Pi.
Will display our name for one file and the other will be displaying temperature, pressure and humidity.

## [Lab 2:](https://github.com/andy-ngo/SYSC3010_Ngo_Andy/tree/master/lab2)
Focuses on learning how to use SQLite on the terminal and with the DBManager. As well as learning a bit of JSON, this will be implemented along with
the rest of the things that were taught in the earlier part of the lab.

## [Lab 3:](https://github.com/andy-ngo/SYSC3010_Ngo_Andy/tree/master/lab3)
This lab focuses on using the IoT databases, as in ThingSpeak and Firebase. ThingSpeak will use the data collected from the Sense Hat and plot the data. The second
part of ThingSpeak is that it requires the keys of the group members to all ThingSpeak to plot their data. For Firebase it follows ThingSpeak and will require the data from the SenseHat and a group member.

## [Lab 4:](https://github.com/andy-ngo/SYSC3010_Ngo_Andy/tree/master/lab4)
This lab focuses on learning how to properly use Github as a team to prepare for the project. Looks into issues, branches, pull requests and forks.

## [Lab 5:](https://github.com/andy-ngo/SYSC3010_Ngo_Andy/tree/master/lab5)
This lab goes over how to use the Pi-Cam and how to distinguish changes in the picture.
